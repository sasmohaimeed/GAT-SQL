# GAT-SQL

Hello / Using the Colab file you can run the GPT-3.5-turbo and get the same best results as we got.
You will need the following files to run Colab cells successfully.

predict.txt
dev.json
table.json
database.zip // because it is too large and we cannot upload it to GitHub. Therefore, you can take it from the SParC database official website https://yale-lily.github.io/sparc


For the other type of prompts, you can edit the cell related to the construction of the prompt.
Or you can communicate with us using this email sasmohaimeed@gmail.com
